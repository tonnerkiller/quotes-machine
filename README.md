My take on the [Free Code Camp Random Quote Machine 
Challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-random-quote-machine). 
The 
app 
retrieves quotes from a number of quote APIs and prints them to screen, 
with the option to send them to Twitter or 
[Hubzilla](https://github.com/redmatrix/hubzilla).

It needs some polishnig of the html/css part, and a restructuring of the 
code might make it easier to enhance. Additionally, it is not yet able 
to deal with tweeting quotes that are longer than twitters maximum sign 
rate, and there is no error handling.

See it life on
